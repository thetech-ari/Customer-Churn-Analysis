## 🔍 Project Overview

Subscription businesses lose revenue every time a customer cancels. This project simulates the full workflow a data analyst would follow at a streaming or SaaS company — from raw data ingestion to actionable business recommendations.

**Business Question:** *Which customers are most likely to churn, and what factors drive cancellation?*

**Answer Found:** Three factors account for the majority of churn risk:
1. 🔴 **Low engagement** — customers logging in < 3×/month churn at 3–4× the rate of active users
2. 🟡 **Short tenure** — customers in their first 0–3 months have the highest churn rate
3. 🟠 **Billing issues** — even 1 failed payment doubles a customer's churn probability
